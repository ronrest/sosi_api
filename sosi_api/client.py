All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
Data is returned in ascending order. Oldest first, newest last.
All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.

------------
TODO: ERROR CODES to look out for
------------
HTTP 4XX return codes are used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
HTTP 403 return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
HTTP 429 return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
HTTP 418 return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving 429 codes.
HTTP 5XX return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side. It is important to NOT treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is UNKNOWN and could have been a success

------------
PARAMETERS
------------
SOme considerations (from binance API)
For GET endpoints, parameters must be sent as a query string.
For POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a query string or in the request body with content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. You may mix parameters between both the query string and request body if you wish to do so.
Parameters may be sent in any order.
If a parameter sent in both the query string and request body, the query string parameter will be used.

------------
TODO: RATE LIMITS
------------
The following `intervalLetter` values for headers:
SECOND => S
MINUTE => M
HOUR => H
DAY => D

`intervalNum` describes the amount of the interval.
- For example, intervalNum 5 with intervalLetter M means "Every 5 minutes".

The /api/v3/exchangeInfo `rateLimits` array contains objects related to the
exchange's RAW_REQUESTS, REQUEST_WEIGHT, and ORDERS rate limits. These are
further defined in the ENUM definitions section under Rate limiters (rateLimitType).
A 429 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.


A `Retry-After` header is sent with a `418` or `429` responses and will give the
number of seconds required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or,
in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.

The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.

We recommend using the websocket for getting data as much as possible, as this
will not count to the request rate limit.

ORDER RATE LIMIT
Every successful order response will contain a X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
When the order count exceeds the limit, you will receive a 429 error without the Retry-After header. Please check the Order Rate Limit rules using GET api/v3/exchangeInfo and wait for reactivation accordingly.
Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-** headers in the response.
The order rate limit is counted against each account.
